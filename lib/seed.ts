    excerpt: "Building in public keeps me accountable, attracts the right people, and turns the messy process of learning into something others can learn from too.",
    content: `Building in public is one of the best decisions I've made as a developer.

When I started working on Oras, I had two choices: build quietly until it was "ready", or share the journey from day one. I chose the latter — and here's why it changed everything.

## Accountability you can't fake

When you tweet about what you're building, you create a public commitment. You can't just abandon a project silently. Your followers, however small, are watching. That mild social pressure is surprisingly powerful when motivation dips at 2am.

## The right people find you

I've had developers reach out to collaborate, potential users offer feedback before I even launched, and other student builders share tools that saved me weeks of work. None of that happens if you build behind closed doors.

## Learning compounds faster

Explaining what you built — even badly — forces clarity. I've caught bugs by writing about my code. I've reconsidered architecture decisions while drafting a thread. Teaching accelerates learning.

## The messy middle is the most valuable part

Nobody needs another "I built X in Y days" success post. What's actually useful is the part where everything broke, the pivot, the rewrite, the week you wanted to quit. That's the stuff that helps other builders.

If you're a student developer sitting on a half-finished project — start sharing it now. Not when it's done. Now.`,

    excerpt: "From idea to live product as a 3rd year student — the technical decisions, the mistakes, and what I'd do differently.",
    content: `Oras is live. Here's what building and shipping it actually taught me.

## Start with the problem, not the stack

I spent the first two weeks choosing between frameworks instead of talking to potential users. Classic mistake. The tech doesn't matter if nobody wants the thing you're building.

## MVP means embarrassingly minimal

My first version of Oras had one feature. Just one. I kept wanting to add more before launching. Then I remembered: you don't learn until real people use your product. Ship the one thing, learn, then build the next.

## Auth will eat your time

User authentication always takes 3x longer than expected. Next time I'll reach for a managed auth solution on day one instead of trying to roll my own.

## The deployment gap

There's a huge gap between "works on my machine" and "works for everyone". Environment variables, edge cases on different devices, unexpected API rate limits — none of this shows up in local development.

## What I'd do differently

1. Talk to 10 potential users before writing a single line of code
2. Set a hard launch date at the start and work backwards
3. Keep a build log from day one — memory fades fast

Still learning. Still shipping.`,

    excerpt: "University teaches you CS theory. The internet teaches you to ship. Here's how I'm trying to do both.",
    content: `I'm a 3rd year CS student at Manav Rachna University. I also build and ship real products on the side. These two things are more different than you'd think.

## What university is good at

Fundamentals. Data structures, algorithms, networking, operating systems — the theory that makes you understand *why* things work, not just *how* to use them. This stuff matters more than most bootcamp-brained takes suggest.

## What university doesn't teach

Shipping. Product thinking. How to write code that real users will interact with. How to handle a production incident. How to read a GitHub issues thread and figure out what's actually broken.

## How I bridge the gap

I treat every university project as a real product. README, deployment, clean commit history — even if nobody will ever use it.

I build things that scratch my own itch. Oras came from a genuine problem I had. Personal motivation > assignment motivation every time.

I spend time in public dev communities. Twitter/X, Discord servers, open source repos. Watching how experienced developers think is free education.

## The honest take

Being a student with real projects is a superpower in hiring. Most of your competition has grades. You have deployed software.

Keep building. Keep shipping.`,
